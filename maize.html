<p><u>What fertilizer to use for maize</u><br>

Generally, every farmer applied Farm Yard Manure at the land preparation time in corn farming. But if you want a high yield of maize crop then apply following inorganic fertilizers on farm per hectare.<br>
Super phosphate: 470 kg<br>
Urea: 200 kg<br>
Potash : 180 kg<br>
You should also apply following inorganic fertilizers on farm per hectare after 20 days of sowing.<br>
Urea: 50 to 60 kg<br>
After 40 days of sowings apply following fertilizers on farm per hectare for getting a high yield of the maize crop.<br>
Urea: 120 kg<br>
Potash: 50 kg

<p><u>Best Irrigation System For Maize</u><br>
In Maize farming, you can require irrigation immediately after sowing of corn seeds are done. On the basis of soil type and seasons give the life irrigation to maize crop on the third or fourth day of sowing. Life irrigation system may not require in the rainy season. Normally, up to 25 to 30 days in maize cultivation process, you can require less irrigation. Then after maize crop requires irrigation once in a week.</p>

<p><u>Soil type:</u><br>
Maize needs a dry soil in the spring, but not a soil type that will dry out too much in late spring when the young plants are developing.
Growing maize on heavy, clay-type soils is probably the biggest handicap to trying to get the best out of this crop because of the difficulty in creating the correct seed-bed in the spring.
Medium loams that are easy to work in the spring, free-draining and will warm up early in the season to enable the young plants to get the best possible start are the most favoured.
Very free-draining and light, sandy soils can be too extreme.</p>


<p><u>Weed Control Methods In Maize Production</u><br>
For a better yield of the maize crop, you may require a two hand wedding. You must remove extra weed around maize plants after 20 to 25 days of sowing and then after other weeds are taking on 40 to 45 days of sowing.</p>
