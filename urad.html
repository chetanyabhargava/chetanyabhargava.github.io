<p><u>Climatic Conditions Required</u><br>
Black gram cultivation is suitable for moist and hot weather condition. Normally, the farmers sowing this black gram in summer and Kharif or rainy seasons. The temperature in between 25 to 350 C is perfect for the black gram cultivation in India. Black gram cultivation process requires the 60 to 75 cm annual rainfall but heavy rain damage the flower. Black gram farming is done successfully at 1800 meters high from the sea level.</p>

<p><u>Type Of Soil Required For Black Gram Cultivation</u><br>
Black gram cultivation requires the black cotton soil, sandy loam, loam or heavy clay loam soils. It does not grow well in the waterlogged, saline soil and alkaline soils. Black gram is grown well on all types of little heavy soil. Black gram crop also requires the natural PH of the soil it is appropriate for the high yield. The soil must have a better water holding potential and well drained.</p>

<p><u>Land Preparation For Black Gram Cultivation</u><br>
If you want to plan for black gram cultivation then first of all the land preparations are very needful. The selected land must not be sown the black gram in a previous year. You are planning to start cultivation in Kharif season then plowed the selected land in summer by using two or three harrowing. Before sowing a seed in field remove the extra weed and stone from the land. Apply 5 to 6-tonne compost or farm yard manure before sowing black gram. You can also provide the irrigation if it is required before sowing the seeds.</p>


<p><u>Seed Selection And Treatment In Black Gram Cultivation</u><br>
The selection of seed plays the most important role for the successful black gram cultivation. When you select the seed for black gram cultivation then must care the selected seeds should be free from the pest, insect, diseases, dust particles and weed. Seed should be well growing and clean. Generally, prefer to purchase seeds from the Agril, research station, Agril service centers, Agriclinics and registered seed companies.
<br>
First, apply 2.5-gram thiram on one kg black gram seeds. Also, treat this selected seeds with rhizobium and atmospheric nitrogen.   
There are basically two methods are available for the sowing seed and this both method can be done by using the tractor or Bullock Ferti-cum-seed drill.
</p>
<p><u>Line sowing method</u><br>
Drilling sowing method
You can use this Ferti-cum-seed drill for applying the fertilizers and sowing seed at the same time. The maximum depth of the sown seed must be 5 to 6 cm.
</p>
 
<p><u>Seed rate and Sowing</u><br>
Optimum sowing time mid June subject to availability of moisture/rainfall. Seed rate is 15-20 kg/ha for kharif and 25-30 kg/ha for spring or rabi. Row-to-row distance is 30-35 cm for kharif and 25 cm for rabi or spring.</p>

<p><u>Interculture</u><br>
Control of weeds within 2 to 3 weeks not only prevents drawn of nutrients from the soil by weeds but also conserves moisture and helps in quick growth and development of crops. Line sowing will facilitate hoeing and weeding operation between the lines.<br>
Weeding and hoeing is to be done between 25-30 days after sowing and if the weeds are still present in the field the 2nd weeding should be done at 45 days after sowing. Chemical herbicides like Pendimethalin or Metalachlor @ 1.0-1.5 kg/ha are found very effective as post emergence.</p>

<p><u>Irrigation</u><br>
The pulse crops in Rabi and Pre rabi seasons are mostly grown on residual soil moisture condition. However irrigation should be provided at critical growth stage i.e flowering and pod development stage.</p>
