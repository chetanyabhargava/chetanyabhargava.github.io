<p><u> How To Cultivate Bajra?</u><br>
To cultivate the bajra, at first, you have to choose a proper area which is apt for this farming. Then you have to select an array based on the zone where you can farm them. Appropriate amount and type of soil and nutrition are very important to get the best product.</p>

<p><u>Soil Conditions For Bajra Farming</u><br>
Bajra can be developed on a large array of soils. The Pearl millet blossoms well in the fine drained soil which have optimum moisture. It is very sensitive in the case of acidic soils and waterlogging. Pearl millet is developed fruitfully on the black cotton soils, alluvial soils and poor sandy soils of India.</p>

<p><u>Land Preparation In Bajra Farming</u><br>
To prepare the land the crops need very well tilt as the seeds are very small. It also needs a good harrowing and ploughing. Appropriate distribution of the seeds at a proper depth is also needed. You must to control and eliminate the unwanted plants like weeds and crop volunteers to decrease the competition with the entire traditional main crop. You also have to offer some favorable circumstances for planting, permitting germination and good plant development.Then you have to maintain the fertility and the productivity on a regular basis by preserving the soil organic substance and by avoiding erosion. After that, you have to make a smooth progress of mixing the lime, fertilizer and the agro-chemical products in the soil. Timely land preparation makes the timely sowing much more easily. It ensures higher productivity. Before the Field preparation, you have to eliminate all the crop volunteers, crop residues, and the weeds.</p>

<p><u>Propagation And Planting Method In Bajra Farming</u><br>
There are three methods of bajra sowing which you have to follow before the preparation. First one is, you must be planted it on a plane surface. Then you have to use the ridge-and-furrow method and the last one system which you have to follow is the bed-and-furrow system. When the seeds are already implanted by using the method of ridge and furrow, then either the seeds have to sown at the very bottom part of the furrow or else on the top or beside of the ridge. This method is mainly followed in the areas where heavy rainfall is a regular matter and under the irrigated conditions. The system named, broadband-and-furrow has an extra advantage over the flat sowing in draining off the excess water. It also provides more soil ventilation for thegrowth of the plants. It is easier for digging over and the mechanical harvesting.</p>

<p><u>Spacing In Bajra Farming</u><br>
The minimum distance between two plants in a row and rows of plants can differ on the system of sowing. But you must keep in mind that the planting distance decides the most advantages plant stand requirement. Generally, if ridges are shaped 45 centimeters apart, then the plants must stay in 12 to 15 centimeters apart in a row. If furrow or the broad bed method is adopted, then the rows of the plant will be at a distance of 60 cm on the bed and the space between the plants must be 10 cm for the best productivity.</p>

<p><u>Fertiliser Application In Bajra Farming</u><br>
Fertilizers and Manures perform a very important role in the cultivation of pearl millet. The using of manures perks up the natural physical condition of soils and boosts the capacity of water retaining. The fertilizers are spread in the split doses. Potash, full phosphorus and half of nitrogen must be placed at the bottom in the time of sowing. You have to apply the organic fertilizers 20 days ago of the planting of the seeds for full decay.Â  One-fourth dosage of nitrogen must be applied more or less 30 and 60 days after the planting.</p>

<p><u>Irrigation Methods Of Bajra Farming</u><br>
Bajra is specially grown in the rainy situation. Only 8% of bajra region is irrigated in India. Irrigation permits the proficient use of inputs in the bajra farming. It increases the productions as well as improves the quality of grain. Irrigation helps to reduce the risk and improves the reliability. Moreover, it increases the profitability.</p>

<p><u>Disease And Pest Management Of Bajra Farming</u><br>
The general diseases and pests which affect the bajra plants are:
Rust
Cercospora leaf spot
Ergot
Smut
Downy mildew
Striga or Purple Witchweed [Orobanchaceae]
You can control most of the diseases of the pearl millet if the bajra is farmed with appropriate irrigation technique, soil, nutrition and intercultural method. For the other sickness, you can use proper pesticides.</p>

<p><u>Yield Of Bajra Farming</u><br>
Bajra can supply the cost-effective grain yield of 600 â€“Â 700 kg ha-1 easily under the low and marginal management conditions. With the supplementary ability, the crop generally produces the grain of 4-5 t/ha.Â Moreover, the hybrid crops take time of 80 to 85 days under irrigated and high fertility conditions, especially in the summer days.</p>
<p><u>Harvesting Bajra</u><br>
Bajra must be harvested as soon as possible to reduce fatalities due to the birds and the bad weather. The grown-up bajra on the ground contains 30% of moisture.Â  If the moisture level crosses 25% then it will be very soft to resist the threshing stroke. The perfect moisture content to harvest the bajra grain is more or less 20%.</p>
