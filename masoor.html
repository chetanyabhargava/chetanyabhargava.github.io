<p><u>Climate</u><br>
Lentil requires cold climate. It is very hardy and can tolerate frost and severe winter to a great extent. It require cold temperature during its vegetative growth and warm temperature at the time of maturity. The optimum temperature for growth is 18-300 C. Its range of cultivation extends to an altitude of 3,500 m in north-west hills.</p>

<p><u>Soil Type and Field Preparation</u><br>
Well drained, loam soils with neutral reaction are best for lentil cultivation. Acidic soils are not fit for growing lentil. The soil should be friable and weed free so that seeding could be done at uniform depth.

On heavy soils, one deep ploughing followed by two to three cross harrowing should be done. After harrowing, the field should be levelled by giving a gentle slope to ease irrigation.

Lentil is grown on a wide range of soils ranging from light loamy sand to heavy clay soil in northern parts, and in moderately deep, light black soil in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.</p>

<p><u>Sowing time</u><br>
Recommended sowing time for Rainfed : First fortnight of October in Central and South India and second fortnight of October in North India;
Under irrigated conditions - First fortnight of November in North India
Late sowing : First week of December in rice fallows of NEPZ or on fields vacated very late by kharif crops under irrigated condition.
Seed Rate and Sowing
For small seeded : 40 - 45 kg/ha;
For Bold seeded : 45 - 60 k g/ha;
For Late sown condition : 50 - 60 kg/ha;
For Utera cropping : 60 - 80 kg/ha seed is recommended.
Sowing should be done in rows 30 cm. apart and it should be sown at a lower depth (3 - 4 cm). This could be done either by using a Ferti-seed-drill or by seeding behind desi plough.</p>


<p><u>Plant nutrient management</u><br>
Generally Nitrogen 20 kg. Phosphorus 40 kg. and Sulphur 20 kg. per hectare in medium to low fertile soils as basal dressing. In lentil grown in calcareous alluvial soils, apply 1.6 kg of Boron per ha as basal to each crop. In soils, low in Zn, soil application of 20 kg Zinc Sulphate is recommended under rainfed and late sown condition; foliar spray of 2% urea improves yield.
Masoor dal : Made from red lentils. Dal (also spelled dhal, dahl, or daal) is a Sanskrit term common to many South Asian languages referring to pulses which have been stripped of their outer hulls and split, as well as to the thick, spicy stew prepared therefrom, a mainstay of Indian cuisine. The latter can be seen as a milder cousin of the South Indian sambar. The hulling of a pulse is intended to improve digestibility and palatability, but carries some cost in nutrition by reducing fiber content, not unlike that suffered in the milling of whole grains into refined grains.</p>

<p><u>Cultivation management</u><br>
fertilization In intercropping systems – a practice commonly used in lentil cultivation – herbicides may be needed to assure crop health.[12] Similar to many legume crops, lentils can fix atmospheric nitrogen in the soil with specific rhizobia.[citation needed] Lentils grow well under low fertilizer input conditions, although phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and sulfur may be used for nutrient-poor soils.</p>
